Hoolock Linux aims to bring you Linux on Apple's iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, and iBridge devices with A7-A11, T2 SoC. These SoCs has a boot ROM that is vulnerable to the [checkm8](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/checkm8) exploit, allowing custom OS to be ran.

Bringing Linux to these devices is no easy task, and currently the Linux port are not at the point that allows one to use those devices for their typical use-cases. You can reference our [documentation](https://github.com/hoolocklinux/docs) for brief instructions on booting the kernel, as well as feature support.

Note unlike Apple Silicon Macs, these devices do not feature a hypervisor that allows for (relatively) easy dynamic tracing.

We welcome contributions! If you have issues specifically concering the use of m1n1 bootloader for development, please open an [issue](https://github.com/hoolocklinux/m1n1/issues). For all other issues including booting and kernel issues, open an [issue](https://github.com/hooklocklinux/docs/issues) at the documentation repository.

We would like to thank [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux) for their Apple Silicon Macs effort, as many parts are applicable to those older Apple devices as well.
